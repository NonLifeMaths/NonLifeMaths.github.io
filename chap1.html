<p>The vast majority of human activities involve risk, which is what makes life so exciting. If you’re planning a family barbecue on a summer’s Sunday, you’re in for a rainstorm. If you’ve booked a plane ticket to an island paradise, your flight may be cancelled. If you invite a beautiful woman (or a handsome man, as the case may be) to dinner, your invitation may be politely declined. While the three examples above will at most only result in a wasted Sunday, an extra wait before hitting the white sandy beaches or a (big?) disappointment, many of the risks we face on a daily basis can have dramatic consequences (the death of a loved one, a traffic accident, a fire, …).</p>
<p>In addition to the grief and suffering caused to the victim and his or her family, these adverse events, which we will henceforth refer to as risks, often have economic consequences that can be objectively assessed (using the services of a specialist, for example). For example, if your house were to go up in smoke, an expert could determine how much it would cost to rebuild it, and hence how much you would lose.</p>
<p>Risk is therefore born of uncertainty: risk exists when the individual is unable to predict with certainty the future state of his or her assets. In practice, the term “risk” is often used to designate the cause of the risk, the object of the risk or the consequences of the loss. For example, the risk of fire is the reason for insurance, and a fire risk represents both the building that could fall prey to the flames, and the expense to which the company would be exposed if it granted cover to the owner. Sometimes, the term peril is used to designate the cause of the risk, as in the case of fire peril. Technically, therefore, risk is often confused with the insurer’s benefit.</p>
<p>In the case of economic consequences that can be expressed in monetary terms, these may be covered by a third-party organization, such as a mutual or commercial company. Over the centuries, mechanisms have been developed to transfer the economic consequences of risks to individuals. A new sector of activity has emerged: insurance.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-reason-for-insurance-risquophobia" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> The reason for insurance: risquophobia<a href="chap1.html#the-reason-for-insurance-risquophobia" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>All economic agents (individuals and companies alike) are subject to hazards (fire, accident, death, illness, bankruptcy, unemployment, etc.), the financial consequences of which could threaten their assets. In some cases, their personal fortunes (or equity) may not even be sufficient to cope. Some economic agents are aware of these risks, and seek to protect themselves by transferring some or all of them to other agents. This spontaneous fear of risk is known as risk aversion, or risquophobia. It is the very reason for insurance.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, any decision by a risquophobic agent will involve two considerations: return and risk. For a comparable return, he will always prefer the least risky solution. He will only accept to run a high risk if, in compensation, this choice provides him with sufficient profit. Of course, risk-averse behavior depends on many criteria: a risk-averse agent may well buy a lottery ticket if the financial loss (the price of the ticket) is insignificant, and the pleasure derived from taking part in the draw more than compensates.</p>
<p>It is interesting to distinguish between the insured’s view of risk, which is often subjective and polluted by their degree of aversion to danger, and the insurer’s more objective view of risk. We will not make this distinction in the remainder of this book, and will assume that both parties have accurate knowledge of the transferred risk}) that there is no need to protect themselves against it. Third parties concerned by their financial situation, such as a lender for example, may nevertheless require them to provide guarantees of solvency, obliging them to transfer all or part of the risks to which they are subject. The State may also consider that social unrest resulting from the insolvency of certain citizens would be so damaging to the community that a guarantee obligation should be introduced. The best-known example is the requirement for motorists to have third-party liability insurance. In this way, any damage they may cause to other road users is covered by a solvent organization.</p>

<div id="risk-management-methods" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Risk management methods<a href="chap1.html#risk-management-methods" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Risquophobia, which combines a desire for safety with a fear of hazards, seems to be a characteristic widely shared by human beings. As a result, there are numerous risk management systems, which have varied according to time and region. The main risk management mechanisms are as follows:</p>
<div id="caution-and-self-insurance" class="section level3 hasAnchor" number="2.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Caution and self-insurance<a href="chap1.html#caution-and-self-insurance" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>This is, of course, the most obvious way of reducing risk: it’s “enough” to be cautious. In a nutshell, agents will adopt attitudes aimed at reducing the risks they run. This explains, for example, the decline in household consumption and the consequent increase in the volume of savings in times of economic recession.</p>
<p>Among the techniques applicable to individual management, there is one that is characteristic of risquophobia: diversification. A risquophobic agent will always prefer to carry several small independent risks rather than a single very large one. This is the technical transcription of the popular saying that “you shouldn’t put all your eggs in one basket”.</p>
<div id="risk-mutualization" class="section level4 hasAnchor" number="2.2.1.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.1</span> Risk mutualization<a href="chap1.html#risk-mutualization" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Many perils (accidents, theft, illness, etc.) threaten a large number of people, but ultimately affect only a small number. In this case, the risks are said to be sufficiently dispersed. What’s more, there is often a degree of independence between these risks: the fact that my neighbor causes a road accident generally doesn’t affect the risk of me causing one myself. This distinguishes the risks in question from natural disasters, which affect a large number of people at the same time.</p>
